The raw data file was 8,400 rows with row id and order id to identify and track each products.

  - For Data collection
  - For Data cleaning
  - For creating calculated columns

  - for creating a dashboard
       
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following actions;
1. **Data loading and Inspection**
2. **Handling missing variables**
3. **Data cleaning and formatting**

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA which involves the exploring of the data was used to answer questions such as:
- What is the average Discount percentage by Product category?
- How many products are listed under each category?
- What is the total number of reviews per category?
- Which product has the highest average ratings?
- What is the average actual price versus the discounted price by category?
- Which product has the highest number of reviews?
- How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
- What is the distribution of product ratings? 
- What is the total potential revenue by category? 
- What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
- How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
- How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
- Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
- Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

### Analysis
As displayed in the dashboard below, the product with the highest review is an high speed cable.		
This means that this product is of best quality and gives users best satisfaction, however, the product might not necessarily be the product with the highest revenue.		
The reason for this could be attributed the following: 		
1. **Premium price:** This is a situation where the price of the product is expensive, but of good 		
quality and the product is making wave.		
2. **New Product:** It could be the product is just new to the market, and only few people have 		
access to the product.		
3. **Product Niche:** This could also be that the product is specifically for some set of people such		
that it can not be commonly bought by all and sundry.

Additionally, from the dashboard below, the product category with the highest review is **Electronics**		
which shows that the product of Amazons that are Electronic are of standard quality and they meet users demand.		
Although, this doesn’t translate to the fact that, this products are more purchased or generates the highest revenue for  		
Amazons as reviews doesn’t necessarily means commitment to buy by customers. 
However, I will advise based on this information that they focus more on this product category as it will both generate revenue and integrity of product being bought.

Lastly, from the dashboard, it is seen that the product category with the lowest revenue is Toys & Games. this are seasonal productss and are not in demand by users.
Hence, I will advise that Amazon put less	focus on this product as it doesn’t drive the market or bring any potential	value.
